# Insurance_charge_prediction
In this project, we utilize machine learning techniques to build predictive models that estimate insurance charges for individuals based on factors such as age, gender, BMI,Region and smoking habits.

The primary goal of this repository is to offer a solution for insurance companies, actuaries, and data scientists interested in automating the insurance charge estimation process.
